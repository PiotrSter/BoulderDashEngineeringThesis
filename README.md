# BoulderDashEngineeringThesis

The topic of the thesis is 2D game inspired by one of the classic video game from the 80's - "Boulder Dash". In orginal production player's goal was collect the correct number of diamonds and finded exit.
Achieving this goal hampered by enemies such as "ghost" and "buterfly" and rocks that blocked access to diamonds and they could fall on player causing his death. This thesis focuses mainly on mechanics behavior rocks and coins (in engineering thesis diamonds have been replaced with golden coins). Rocks can be moved left or right, if front of them or behind them is free space. Additionally rocks and coins can't be placed on each other, if they not supported from the side. If the square next to it and square bellow it are free, rocks or coins will fall diagonally (slip). Coins can be collected, and after collecting all coins game will end successfully.
